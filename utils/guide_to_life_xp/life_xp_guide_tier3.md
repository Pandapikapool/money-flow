# Tier 3 – Large Life XP (Operational Rules)

Tier 3 covers **large, life-structure-impacting Life XP**.
This tier is rare, slow, and must be executed with discipline.

---

## 1. Tier Definition (Fixed)

6B < X ≤ 12B


Where:
- **B** = Monthly Budget
- **X** = Total Life XP cost

12B ≈ one full year of budget → absolute XP ceiling.

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Constraints (Hard Rules)

These apply before *any* calculation:

- ❌ No loans / EMIs
- ❌ No leverage
- ❌ No emergency fund usage
- ❌ No speculative future profits
- ❌ Max 2 Tier-3 XPs at a time

If any rule is violated → Tier 3 is **not allowed**.

---

## 3. Mandatory Profit Gate (Entry Condition)

To even **start** Tier 3:

VI_used ≥ max(1B, 0.25 × X)



Where:
- **VI_used** = realized investment profits only
- Unrealized gains do NOT count
- Used VI is **consumed** (never reused)

This means:
- Minimum VI_used range = **1.5B → 3B**
- For X = 12B → VI_used ≥ 3B

---

## 4. Time Window (Fixed)

12 ≤ T ≤ 24 months



- <12 months → reckless
- \>24 months → becomes life-planning, not XP

---

## 5. Monthly Funding Controls (Hard Caps)

### Budget Compression
0 < ΔB ≤ 0.5B


### Investment Diversion
0 < v ≤ 0.5V



Rules:
- Investing is **slowed, never stopped**
- `V_continue = V − v > 0` must always hold

---

## 6. Core Tier-3 Funding Equation

X = VI_used + (ΔB × T) + (v × T)



Rearranged for feasibility:

T = (X − VI_used) / (ΔB + v)



Acceptance condition:
12 ≤ T ≤ 24

go


If `T > 24` even at:
ΔB = 0.5B
v = 0.5V


→ ❌ Tier 3 not allowed yet

---

## 7. Recommended Operating Ranges (Important)

These are **recommended**, not hard limits.

### Recommended Budget Compression
ΔB ≈ 0.30B – 0.40B



Why:
- Tier 3 already has long duration
- Over-compressing B causes burnout

---

### Recommended Investment Diversion
v ≈ 0.25V – 0.40V



Why:
- Keeps compounding alive
- Prevents “investment pause” psychology

---

## 8. Two Types of Tier 3 (Very Important)

To keep the system extensible, Tier 3 is split into **two sub-types**.

---

### 🔹 Tier 3A – Balanced Large XP (Recommended Default)

**When:**
- X is closer to 6B–9B
- Strong VI position
- Stable income

**Characteristics**
VI_used ≈ 25%–30% of X
ΔB ≈ 0.30B–0.40B
v ≈ 0.25V–0.35V
T ≈ 12–18 months



This is the **ideal Tier 3**.
Most people should only ever do **Tier 3A**.

---

### 🔹 Tier 3B – Heavy Large XP (Caution Tier)

**When:**
- X is 9B–12B
- Identity-level decision (car, relocation, etc.)
- Very strong capital base

**Characteristics**
VI_used ≈ 30%–40% of X
ΔB ≈ 0.40B–0.50B
v ≈ 0.35V–0.50V
T ≈ 18–24 months



Rules:
- Max **one Tier 3B at a time**
- Must not overlap with Tier 2 or other Tier 3B

---

## 9. Execution Steps (Operational Flow)

### Step 1 — Classify
Is 6B < X ≤ 12B?


If no → wrong tier.

---

### Step 2 — Check Profit Gate
Is VI_available ≥ max(1B, 0.25X)?


If no → wait.

---

### Step 3 — Choose Sub-Type
- Tier 3A (preferred)
- Tier 3B (rare)

---

### Step 4 — Set Monthly Controls
Choose:
ΔB ≤ 0.5B
v ≤ 0.5V



---

### Step 5 — Verify Time
T = (X − VI_used) / (ΔB + v)

makefile


Ensure:
12 ≤ T ≤ 24



---

### Step 6 — Execute
- Apply VI as planned (start / yearly / end)
- Apply ΔB + v monthly
- No rule changes mid-way

---

## 10. One-Line Tier-3 Rule (Final)

> **A Tier-3 Life XP (6B–12B) is allowed only if at least 25% of its cost comes from realized profits, the remainder is funded via controlled budget compression and investment slowing, it completes within 12–24 months, and it uses zero debt.**

---

## Status

✅ Tier 3 **fully operational and extensible**
