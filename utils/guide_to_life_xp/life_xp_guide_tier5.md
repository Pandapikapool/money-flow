# Tier 5 – Assets & Balance Sheet Decisions (FINAL with CALCULATIONS)

Tier 5 is the **last tier**.
All decisions here are evaluated using **Net Worth (NW)** and **Exposure**,
not monthly budget (B).

------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Core Definitions (Fixed)

- **NW (Net Worth)** = Total Assets − Total Liabilities
- **X** = Asset purchase price (house, land, business, etc.)
- **VI** = Realized investment profits
- **Vp** = Previously invested corpus (principal)
- **Loan** = Borrowed capital
- **Exposure** ≈ Vp_used + Loan
- **Exposure Ratio** = Exposure / NW

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Global Tier-5 Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- ❌ Exposure must NEVER exceed **50% of NW**
- ❌ Net worth after decision must remain **positive**
- ❌ No speculative assumptions (resale, appreciation)
- ❌ Loans allowed ONLY inside defined caps
- ❌ Tier-5 rules override all lower-tier rules

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Minimum Corpus Requirement (Entry Gate)

You asked **when Vp can be used at all**.

### ✅ Tier-5 Entry Condition

Total invested corpus (Vp_total) ≥ 12B


Why 12B?
- Below this, corpus is too fragile
- Withdrawal causes long recovery time
- Market participation risk becomes high

If `Vp_total < 12B` → ❌ Tier 5 NOT allowed

---

## 4. How Much Vp Can Be Used (Key Rule)

### ✅ Principal Usage Rule

Vp_used ≤ 0.50 × X
AND
Post-use corpus ≥ 12B


Meaning:
- Up to **50% of the asset price** can come from existing investments
- But corpus must **never fall below 12B**

This is the **single most important Tier-5 safety rail**.

---

## 5. Mandatory Profit Participation (VI Rule)

Tier-5 still requires **earned capital**, not just savings.

VI_used ≥ 0.25 × X


Rules:
- VI must be realized (booked)
- Unrealized gains do NOT count
- Used VI is consumed (not reused)

---

## 6. Loan Rules (Optional, Controlled)

Loans are allowed, but **only after VI + Vp are applied**.

### ✅ Loan Cap

Loan = X − (VI_used + Vp_used)
Loan ≤ 0.25 × X


This ensures:
- At least **75% of X is self-funded**
- Debt never dominates the decision

---

## 7. Final Tier-5 Funding Equation (Locked)

X =
VI_used (≥ 0.25X)

Vp_used (≤ 0.50X, corpus ≥ 12B)

Loan (≤ 0.25X)


This is the **only allowed structure**.

---

## 8. Exposure Check (Must Pass)

Exposure = Vp_used + Loan
Exposure / NW ≤ 0.50


If this fails → ❌ decision rejected, regardless of affordability.

---

## 9. Tier-5 Sub-Classes (Now Quantified)

### 🟢 Tier 5A — Primary Residence

| Metric | Rule |
|-----|-----|
| VI_used | ≥ 25% X |
| Vp_used | ≤ 50% X |
| Loan | ≤ 25% X |
| Exposure | ≤ 50% NW |
| Use case | Self-occupied home |

---

### 🟡 Tier 5B — Wealth / Income Assets

| Metric | Rule |
|-----|-----|
| VI_used | ≥ 25% X |
| Vp_used | ≤ 40% X |
| Loan | ≤ 20% X |
| Exposure | ≤ 40% NW |
| Use case | Rental, CRE, equity |

---

### 🔴 Tier 5C — High-Risk Bets

| Metric | Rule |
|-----|-----|
| VI_used | ≥ 25% X |
| Vp_used | ≤ 20% X |
| Loan | ≤ 10% X |
| Exposure | ≤ 20% NW |
| Use case | Startup, speculation |

---

## 10. Concrete Examples (This Should Click)

### Example 1 — House Purchase

- NW = 6 Cr
- House (X) = 3 Cr

Funding:
- VI_used = 0.75 Cr (25%)
- Vp_used = 1.5 Cr (50%)
- Loan = 0.75 Cr (25%)

Checks:
- Post-Vp corpus ≥ 12B ✅
- Exposure = 2.25 Cr
- Exposure ratio = 37.5% ✅

→ **Allowed (Tier 5A)**

---

### Example 2 — Rental Property

- NW = 10 Cr
- Property = 4 Cr

Funding:
- VI = 1 Cr
- Vp = 1.6 Cr
- Loan = 0.8 Cr

Exposure:
- 2.4 Cr → 24% NW ✅

→ **Allowed (Tier 5B)**

---

## 11. Decision Shortcut (Memorize This)

> **Tier-5 rule of thumb**  
> 25% must be profits  
> 50% can be old investments  
> 25% max loan  
> Exposure must stay under half your net worth  

If you can’t satisfy this → **don’t do it yet**.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Final One-Line Rule

> **Tier-5 decisions are allowed only when at least 75% of the asset is self-funded (profits + existing corpus), exposure stays below 50% of net worth, and invested capital never drops below a survivable floor.**
