# Tier 4 – Life Architecture (Final Locked Rules)

Tier 4 covers **large, multi-year life decisions** that reshape lifestyle or trajectory.
This tier is designed so that **loans are optional**, not required, and in most cases
**can be avoided entirely** through mature capital usage.

---

## 1. Tier Definition (Fixed)
12B < X ≤ 24B

Where:
- **B** = Monthly Budget
- **X** = Total cost of the decision

This corresponds to **1–2 years of total budget**.

---

## 2. Time Horizon (Years, Fixed)
1 year ≤ T ≤ 3 years

- < 1 year → reckless compression
- > 3 years → becomes Tier 5 (asset / net-worth decision)

All Tier-4 math is done **year-wise**, not month-wise.

---

## 3. Capital Sources Allowed (Tier-4 Only)

Tier 4 explicitly allows **four sources**, in priority order:

1. **VI** → realized investment profits  
2. **Vp** → previously invested principal (existing corpus)  
3. **v** → diversion of ongoing monthly investments  
4. **ΔB** → budget compression  

Loans are **optional** and capped very tightly.

---

## 4. Mandatory Profit Gate (Hard Entry Condition)
VI_used ≥ 0.25 × X

Rules:
- VI must be **realized / booked**
- Unrealized gains do NOT count
- Used VI is **consumed** (cannot be reused)

Examples:
- X = 12B → VI ≥ 3B
- X = 24B → VI ≥ 6B

If this is not met → ❌ Tier 4 cannot start.

---

## 5. Using Previously Invested Principal (Vp)

This is the **key Tier-4 feature**.

### 5.1 Eligibility to Touch Principal

You may use existing invested principal **only if**:
Total invested corpus ≥ 24B
AND
Post-withdrawal corpus ≥ 18B

This ensures:
- Market participation is preserved
- Long-term compounding base survives

---

### 5.2 Principal Usage Limit
Vp_used ≤ 0.25 × X

Meaning:
- Up to **25% of Tier-4 cost** may come from existing investments
- This is **reallocation**, not consumption

---

## 6. Monthly Investment Diversion (v)

Tier 4 allows aggressive but temporary slowing of investing.
v ≤ 0.75V

Rules:
- Applies **only during Tier-4**
- Investments are slowed, not stopped
- A recovery plan is mandatory after Tier-4 ends

---

## 7. Budget Compression (ΔB)

Budget plays a secondary role in Tier 4.
ΔB ≤ 0.30B (recommended)

Why:
- Tier-4 timelines are long
- Over-compression causes burnout
- Capital should do the heavy lifting

---

## 8. Loans (Optional, Not Required)

Because:
- VI ≥ 0.25X
- Vp ≤ 0.25X
→ **0.5X is already covered without loans**

If a loan is used at all:
Loan ≤ 0.20 × X (optional cap)

Loan usage is for **smoothing only**, not dependency.

---

## 9. Core Tier-4 Funding Equation

X =
VI_used (≥ 0.25X)+ Vp_used (≤ 0.25X, corpus ≥ 18B)+(v × 12 × T)
+(ΔB × 12 × T) + Loan (optional, ≤ 0.20X)

With:
1 ≤ T ≤ 3 years

---

## 10. Approval Conditions (All Must Hold)

✔ VI_used ≥ 0.25X  
✔ Vp_used ≤ 0.25X and corpus ≥ 18B after use  
✔ v ≤ 0.75V  
✔ ΔB ≤ 0.30B (recommended)  
✔ Loan ≤ 0.20X (if used)  
✔ T between 1 and 3 years  

If any fail → ❌ NOT READY

---

## 11. Recommended Tier-4 Operating Modes

### Tier 4A – Capital-Strong (Recommended)

- X: 12B–18B
- VI_used: ~25–30%
- Vp_used: ~15–25%
- v: 0.4V–0.6V
- ΔB: 0.2B–0.3B
- Loan: 0

Best case. Minimal regret risk.

---

### Tier 4B – Capital-Heavy (Caution)

- X: 18B–24B
- VI_used: ~25%
- Vp_used: full 25%
- v: 0.6V–0.75V
- ΔB: ~0.3B
- Loan: 0–0.2X (optional)

Use only with strong income stability.

---

## 12. Example – Year-Wise Illustration

### Example: X = 20B, T = 2 years

| Source | Amount |
|------|--------|
| VI_used (25%) | 5B |
| Vp_used (25%) | 5B |
| v × 24 months | 6B |
| ΔB × 24 months | 4B |
| Loan | 0 |
| **Total** | **20B** |

Corpus after Vp withdrawal remains ≥ 18B.

---

## 13. One-Line Tier-4 Rule (Final)

> **Tier-4 Life Architecture (12B–24B) is allowed only if at least 25% comes from realized profits, up to 25% from an existing investment corpus that never drops below 18B, monthly investments may be slowed up to 75%, budget compression is moderate, loans are optional and capped at 20%, and the decision completes within 1–3 years.**

## Status

✅ Tier 4 **fully locked and loan-minimizing**  
➡ Ready to integrate into the full life-decision system
