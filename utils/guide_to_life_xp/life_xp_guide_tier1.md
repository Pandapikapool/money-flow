# Tier 1 – Medium Life XP (Locked Rule)

## 1. Variables

- **B** = Monthly Budget  
- **X** = Cost of the Life XP  
- **ΔB** = Monthly budget compression (saved from B)  
- **T** = Time to fund XP (months)  
- **V** = Investment principal  
- **VI** = Investment profit (interest/returns)  
  - **VI_last** = Profit realized from the *previous year*  
  - **VI_curr** = Profit realized during the *current year*

---

## 2. Tier Definition

1.5B < X ≤ 3B

Examples:
- Bike  
- High-end laptop  
- Long domestic travel  
- Multi-item lifestyle upgrade  

---

## 3. Fixed Time Window (Non-Negotiable)

3 months ≤ T ≤ 6 months

- Less than 3 months → impulsive (should have been Tier 0)
- More than 6 months → fatigue, EMI temptation

---

## 4. Mandatory Profit Gate (Hard Rule)

> **At least 0.5B MUST come from investment profits (VI) only.**

VI_required ≥ 0.5B

Rules:
- ❌ No investment principal (V)
- ❌ No loans / EMIs
- ❌ No budget-only funding

If this condition is not met → **Tier 1 XP is NOT allowed yet**.

---

## 5. Which VI Can Be Used (Very Important)

### Primary Source (Preferred)
Use VI_last first

- VI_last = profits already realized from the *previous year*
- Clean, settled, psychologically safe

### Secondary Source (If Needed)
If VI_last < 0.5B → wait for VI_curr to be realized

Important:
- **Unrealized gains do NOT count**
- Profits must be **actually booked / available**
- Once VI is used, it is **consumed** and cannot be counted again

---

## 6. Remaining Amount Funding

After profit gate:
Remaining = X − 0.5B

This portion is funded via **ΔB only**.

---

## 7. Budget Compression Rules (Same as Tier 0)

Choose ΔB **before starting**:

0.25B ≤ ΔB ≤ 0.50B

Remaining **B − ΔB** must still run normal life.

---

## 8. Time Calculation (Mandatory Check)

T = (X − 0.5B) / ΔB

Rules:
- **T ≤ 6** → allowed
- **T > 6** → reject or reclassify XP

---

## 9. Special Cases

- If **VI ≥ X**  
  → XP can be purchased immediately (still Tier 1)
- If **ΔB < 0.25B**  
  → Acceptable only if **T ≤ 3 months**
- If multiple XPs exist  
  → Profit gate applies **per Tier 1 XP**, not combined

---

## 10. Profit Accounting Rule (Critical)

> **Once VI is used for Life XP, it is removed from future VI calculations.**

Meaning:
- You do NOT double-count profits
- Current-year profit used for XP is **not counted again** at year-end
- VI tracking must be explicit, not assumed

---

## 11. Final One-Line Rule

> **A Tier 1 Life XP (1.5B–3B) is allowed only if at least 0.5B comes from already-realized investment profits, and the remaining amount can be funded via budget compression within 3–6 months.**

---

## 12. Mental Shortcut

1. Is X between 1.5B and 3B?  
2. Do I have ≥ 0.5B in realized profits?  
3. Can the rest be done via ΔB in ≤ 6 months?  
4. If yes → proceed guilt-free  

Else → wait.

Mandatory Profit Gate
VI_used ≥ 0.5B   (realized profits only)

Remaining Amount
Remaining = X − 0.5B

Funding

Remaining amount via ΔB

Profit used is consumed and not reused

Constraints
ΔB ≤ 0.5B per month
3 ≤ T ≤ 6 months

Formula
T = (X − 0.5B) / ΔB

Allowed if
VI ≥ 0.5B
AND
T ≤ 6 (when ΔB = 0.5B)
AND
Total monthly ΔB (all XPs) ≤ 0.5B
