# Small Life XP – Simple Guideline

## 1. Variables

- **B** = Monthly Budget  
- **X** = Cost of the Life XP  
- **ΔB** = Monthly budget compression (amount saved from B)  
- **T** = Time to fund the Life XP (in months)

---

## 2. Fixed Rule (Non-Negotiable)

- **Maximum time allowed:**
  T ≤ 3 months

Any Life XP that cannot be funded within **3 months** is **not a Small Life XP**.

---

## 3. Allowed Life XP Size
   X ≤ 1.5B


- If **X > 1.5B** → not allowed under this rule  
- No investments, no interest, no loans

---

## 4. Choose Monthly Compression (User Choice)

You **must choose ΔB in advance**.
0.25B ≤ ΔB ≤ 0.50B

Guidance:
- **0.25B** → comfortable  
- **0.30–0.40B** → stretch  
- **0.50B** → aggressive (rare)

Remaining **B − ΔB** runs normal life.

---

## 5. Calculate Time (Mandatory Step)

T = X / ΔB

Rules:
- **T ≤ 3** → allowed  
- **T > 3** → reject or reclassify XP  

---

## 6. Special Cases

- If **X ≤ 0.5B**  
  → Can be purchased in **1 month**
- If **ΔB < 0.25B**  
  → It is okay to finish in **1–2 months**
- Finishing in **less than 3 months is always acceptable**

---

## 7. Final One-Line Rule

> A Small Life XP must be fully funded within **3 months** using a pre-decided monthly budget cut between **25% and 50% of B**.

---

## 8. Mental Shortcut

1. Decide the Life XP  
2. Pick compression level (25%–50%)  
3. Ensure it completes within 3 months  
4. Buy guilt-free


Constraints
ΔB ≤ 0.5B per month
T ≤ 3 months

Formula
T = X / ΔB

Allowed if
X ≤ 1.5B
AND
T ≤ 3
AND
Total monthly ΔB (all XPs) ≤ 0.5B
